TON_IoT is for the code of TON_IoT dataset

MalMem is for the code of CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset

NSL-KDD is for the code of NSL-KDD dataset

The code name begins with evaluate.... is for the Precision-Recall Curve and ROC curve evaluation

The data has been preprocessed and it is divided into traing set (70%) and test set(20%).
